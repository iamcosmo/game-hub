# GAME HUB NITRO

This is a small react ⚛️ project made using **REACT**. It is a ***mini clone-version*** of a very popular website [RAWG.io](https://rawg.io/) 

I have used [**CHAKRA-UI**](https://chakra-ui.com/) for styling the UI and [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) for launching the site. 

**My Site: [GAME-HUB-NITRO](https://game-hub-iamcosmo.vercel.app/)**
